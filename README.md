This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# What is it?

This is a React/Node.js applications that allows a user to search for any movie by title and get a tailored list of movies that best fit the search criteria. 
It shows the movie poster, a short description of the film, and a button to go to the movie's MovieDB page for any further information. The applications uses the MoviesDB API in order to get the most relevant movies relating to the search and consumes the JSON returned in order to build the application.
